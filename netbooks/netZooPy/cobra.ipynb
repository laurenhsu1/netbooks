    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "COBRA decomposes a gene co-expression network as a linear combination of covariate-specific components. It takes as input a gene co-expression network and a design matrix. Depending on the choice of the covariates in the design matrix, COBRA can be used to tackle different tasks in system biology. In this tutorial we show how it can be applied for batch correction, differential co-expression analysis controlling for variables, and to understand the impact of variables of interest to the observed co-expression. \n",

Please follow the installation guidelines on the [README](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooPy/blob/master/README.md).
